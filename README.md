#YouTube WatchLater to Playlist

##Problem

If you used YouTube, you probably have used it's WatchLater list.
You also might have created and/or used other Playlists YouTube provides.
However, these two are different kinds of lists.
The WatchLater is limiting in the way Videos are ordered and the unchangeable defaults are unusable and annoying, frankly.

##Solution

This little utility is here to help.
It uses Google's YouTube API to locate your WatchLater playlist (for some reason this is not a trivial and undocumented feature of the API).
Then it creates a new playlist named ToWatchLater (by default) which includes everything you have in the WatchLaer list.

##Some features

- It will avoid creating duplicate Videos in the new list it creates.
- It will by default sort them in descending order (newest on top, unlike YouTube's WatchLater list)
